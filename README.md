## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

This project is built on the **MERN stack**:  
- **MongoDB** → Database (stores user data, course data, enrollments)  
- **Express.js** → Backend framework (handles routes, API endpoints)  
- **React.js** → Frontend (interactive user interface)  
- **Node.js** → Server runtime (runs backend logic, connects Express to MongoDB)
